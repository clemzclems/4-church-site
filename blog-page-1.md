# Creation Story
*Genesis 1-2*

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. This incredible act of creation took place over six days, during which God spoke everything into existence.

## Day 1: Light and Darkness
God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. He separated the light from the darkness, calling the light "Day" and the darkness "Night." This marked the first day of creation.

## Day 2: Sky and Waters
On the second day, God created a vast expanse to separate the waters. He called the expanse "Sky." The separation of the waters into those above and below the sky created the atmosphere we experience.

## Day 3: Land, Seas, and Vegetation
God gathered the waters together so that dry land appeared, which He called "Earth," and the gathered waters "Seas." Then, He commanded the earth to bring forth vegetation, plants, and trees, each yielding seed according to its kind.

## Day 4: Sun, Moon, and Stars
On the fourth day, God created the sun to govern the day, the moon to govern the night, and also the stars. These celestial bodies were set in the sky to mark the seasons, days, and years.

## Day 5: Sea Creatures and Birds
God filled the waters with a multitude of living creatures and the skies with birds. He blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply," ensuring the diversity of life in both the sea and the air.

## Day 6: Land Animals and Humans
On the sixth day, God created the land animals, each according to its kind. Finally, He created man in His own image. He formed Adam from the dust of the earth and breathed life into him. Later, God created Eve as a companion for Adam. He gave them dominion over all other creatures and entrusted them with the care of His creation.

## Day 7: Rest
After six days of creation, God rested on the seventh day, blessing it and making it holy. This day of rest is a testament to the completion and perfection of His creative work.

The Creation Story reminds us of the power, wisdom, and love of God. It establishes the foundation of faith and the understanding that all life is a gift from Him.
