# Noah's Ark
*Genesis 6-9*

In a time when humanity had become corrupt and filled with wickedness, God found Noah to be a righteous man. God decided to cleanse the earth with a great flood but promised to save Noah, his family, and representatives of all living creatures.

## God's Command
God instructed Noah to build a large ark according to specific dimensions and materials. This ark was to be the vessel that would save Noah, his family, and every kind of animal from the impending flood.

## The Building of the Ark
Noah obeyed God's command without question. He built the ark meticulously, following every instruction given. His faith and perseverance were evident in his diligent work, despite the mockery of his neighbors.

## The Flood
Once the ark was completed, God sent a great flood that covered the earth. Rain poured for 40 days and 40 nights, and the waters rose above the highest mountains. All living creatures outside the ark perished in the deluge.

## Life Inside the Ark
Noah, his family, and the animals lived together inside the ark for many days. Despite the confined space and challenging conditions, they remained safe as the floodwaters raged on outside.

## The Rainbow Promise
After the floodwaters receded, Noah and his family emerged to repopulate the earth. God made a covenant with Noah, promising that He would never again destroy the world with a flood. As a sign of this promise, God set a rainbow in the skyâ€”a symbol of hope and divine mercy.

Noah's Ark is a powerful story of obedience, faith, and renewal. It teaches us that God is just, yet merciful, and that His promises are everlasting.
