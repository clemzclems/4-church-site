# Jonah and the Whale
*Jonah 1-2*

Jonah's story is one of disobedience, repentance, and God's mercy. God called Jonah to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh, but Jonah tried to run away from his responsibility.

## Jonah's Flight
Instead of obeying God, Jonah boarded a ship headed in the opposite direction. When a fierce storm threatened the ship, Jonah realized that the tempest was a consequence of his disobedience. He urged the sailors to throw him overboard.

## The Great Fish
After being cast into the sea, Jonah was swallowed by a giant fish (often called a whale). For three days and three nights, Jonah remained in the belly of the fish, where he had time to reflect and pray for forgiveness.

## A Change of Heart
Inside the fish, Jonah prayed earnestly to God, repenting for his disobedience. In response, God commanded the fish to vomit Jonah onto dry land, giving him a second chance.

## The Message Delivered
Renewed and determined, Jonah went to Nineveh to deliver God's message. The people of Nineveh repented, and God spared the city from destruction.

Jonah and the Whale is a moving story of redemption, showing that no matter how far we stray, God's mercy is always available.
