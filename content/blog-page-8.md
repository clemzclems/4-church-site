# The Prodigal Son
*Luke 15:11-32*

The parable of the Prodigal Son is a profound lesson on forgiveness, unconditional love, and the restorative power of grace.

## The Wayward Son
A younger son asked his father for his share of the inheritance and left home to live a life of indulgence. His reckless spending led him to a state of extreme poverty and despair.

## The Moment of Realization
Broken by hunger and regret, the prodigal son resolved to return home, expecting only to be treated as a servant. However, his father ran to embrace him, overwhelmed with joy at his return.

## A Celebratory Reunion
The father's warm reception, complete with a feast and celebration, symbolized the boundless love and forgiveness that God extends to all who repent. Even the elder brother, who felt overlooked, learned about the depth of grace and compassion.

The Prodigal Son teaches us that no matter how far we wander, God's love is always ready to welcome us home.
